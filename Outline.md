# Outline of Borneo Ecosystem

The Borneo Ecosystem consists of many parts while also integrating interconnectiveness through its brilliant use of cryptography.

## Design

### Basic Design

The Basic Design of Borneo relies on using **pivots** (an initial starting point), **block lattices**, and **bridges** to communicate. It also uses a self-building blockchain as its basis while taking advantage of Raspberry Pis (specifically the 5th generation).

It uses Libp2p for peer-to-peer networking.
